# Web tools

This project is developped for help junior developpers to understand and use different properties.
As trainer in web development, I saw many of my students have difficulties.

There are lot of project doing the same as mine, but often each one on differents places.
My goal is to bring them all in the same project.

## Choice of technologies

Even if I thought to use SCSS, Typescript or others, I choosed to work on the bases.
Nothing more than HTML, CSS, Javascript, but with the last evolutions.
problem of this project, lack of polyfill, old navigators could have some difficulties.
